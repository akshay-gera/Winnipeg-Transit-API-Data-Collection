    "## Situation\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a big list of 5085 bus stops and for each stop we need to make a seperate api call to fetch bus stop features data for each bus stop\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the limit to api calls are 100 requests per minute on Winnipeg Transit Website, for 5085 requests we have to explore different way\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We will covert the bus stops list into lists of smaller lists(chunks) of 100s  bus stops and have to make calls in chunks of 100 bus stops at 60 seconds intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "This way we can make api calls for every chunk of 100 bus stops in the big list of 5085 elements \n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Roadmap for the Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function called 'divide_chunks' to convert 'stop_numbers_list' into a list of smaller lists (of 100 bus stops each). We will call the resultant list 'bus_stops_chunks'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Create a function called 'bus_stop_features_chunkwise' which will run a loop to get inside every element in the 'bus_stops_chunks' list and will make an api call for each bus stop. \n",
    "\n",
    "b) The function will start relies on chunk_index which is starting point in the bus_stops_chunk list. For each loop, the chunk_index will increment by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) So when the function is run again after 60 seconds intreval, the loop is run on next chunk of the 'bus_stops_chunks' list.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) The data will be transferred to 'df_stop_features_per_chunk' DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3 \n",
    "\n",
    "a) Create a function 'bus_stops_features' to run the above function for each chunk_index value which is incrementing by 1 in every run of the function 'bus_stop_features_chunkwise'\n",
    "\n",
    "b) On every loop the data of each chunk will be pushed to 'df_stop_features' DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a schedule to run the function 'bus_stops_features' in every 60 seconds intrevals and stop after all chunk_indexes are covered in the bus_stops_list"
